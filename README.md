## 🔍 Overview

This repository showcases **algorithmically rich R code** designed to test **reasoning, correctness, and performance**, directly aligned with Turing’s **Sr. R Engineer – Code Reasoning & Benchmark** role.

Each folder demonstrates problem-solving across **data structures, algorithms, graphs, number theory, and test automation**, with structured metadata for evaluation.

## ⚙️ Example Problems

- **Segment Tree** → Fast range sum queries in `O(log n)` and point updates  
- **Union Find (DSU)** → Connectivity queries with path compression + union by rank  
- **Greedy Scheduler** → Select jobs by earliest deadline while maximizing throughput  
- **DP Pathfinding** → Minimal path sum on a grid (bottom-up DP)  
- **Dijkstra** → Single-source shortest paths on weighted directed graphs  
- **Modular Inverse** → Extended Euclidean Algorithm with `O(log m)` complexity  
- **Testing Harness** → Validate solutions and benchmark runtime performance
